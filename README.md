Project Goals
-----
For V1, I built a UI that dynamically displayed songs from a JSON file.
In V2, I migrated the data to Firebase and hooked it up to an AngularJS frontend.
This project was a way to test my front-end skills, learn all the flavors of web-based JS (vanilla, JQuery, and Angular), and keep my hands in the same codebase over several weeks.

Technologies
------------
V1: Vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, JSON
V2: AngularJS, Firebase, Grunt/SASS

Features
------------
In V2, users can create, read, update, and delete songs.
You can also filter songs by using the search bar.
